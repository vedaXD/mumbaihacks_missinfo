      "explanation": "The search results are largely irrelevant to the claim that Modi announced the banning of 100 rupee notes. The results discuss a police officer's assets, a commemorative coin, and the DID model (Difference in Differences) in econometrics. The absence of any credible news reports or official announcements about banning currency, especially from major news outlets, strongly suggests the claim is false. This type of claim aligns with a common misinformation pattern of falsely reporting currency bans.

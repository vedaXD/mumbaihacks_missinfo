Shivakumar have expressed their views criticising each other, they have been seen together at several official functions. File\n\nA day after Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy D.K. Shivakumar used social media to target each other amidst a leadership battle, both have decided to hold a breakfast meeting on Saturday (November 29) at the former’s residence here.\n\nThe Chief Minister said, “High command telephoned and told both of us to meet. Therefore, I invited him for a breakfast meeting.”\n\nThe Chief Minister reiterated that there was no change in his stand. “I will listen to whatever high command says. He (Mr. Shivakumar) has also said that several times,” Mr Siddaramaiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n Congress govt. can fall if Shivakumar is not made Chief Minister, says seer\n\nWhen asked whether he would go to Delhi, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he would do so if invited.\n\nIn a damage-control exercise, the high command is believed to have instructed both leaders to hold a breakfast meeting.\n\nAs the Winter Session of the State legislature session would commence on December 8 in Belagavi, the meeting between two Congress leaders would also send a message to the rival BJP and JD(S) that all is well in the ruling dispensation. The Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday (December 1).\n\n Leadership change: Congress high command carefully weighing multiple options\n\nThough the two leaders expressed their views criticising each other, they attended the Cabinet meeting and several official functions of the government in the last few days.\n\nSources also said the breakfast meeting would also provide the high command some leeway to hold talks with the two leaders and buy some time to take firm decisions in the interest of the party.\n\nThe question is whether the breakfast meeting between two leaders would be just a photo opportunity or provide a common ground to make a temporary truce.\n\nPublished - November 28, 2025 09:04 pm IST\n\n READ COMMENTS\nREAD LATER\nPRINT\nRelated Topics\n\nKarnataka / Indian National Congress / state politics\n\nMost Popular\nIndescribable loss: Hema Malini shares pictures in first post since with Dharmendra’s death\nA former Minister and his ‘vada case’\nMaharashtra declares paid holiday on December 2 for voting in civic council, nagar panchayat polls\nTop News\nLeadership change: Congress high command carefully weighing multiple options\nGO TO HOME\nSix-year-old’s ear bitten off by pitbull in Delhi; owner arrested\nDiscover\nIAS officer Mahantesh Bilagi, two relatives die in road accident near Kalaburagi\nDiscover\nHiranandani Exclusive\nServiced Apartments by Hiranandani Coming Soon to Alibaug\nRead More\nSkip\nCelina Jaitly moves court against 'narcissistic' husband; accuses him of domestic violence, cruelty\nDiscover\nAfter poll drubbing, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj Party dissolves all organisational units\nDiscover\nLuxury 2 & 3 BHK Homes at Piramal Mahalaxmi | Central Tower OC Received\nPiramal Mahalaxmi\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nRunwal 2, 3 BHK Residences from ₹2.54 Cr+ All Incl.\nRunwal Enterprises\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\n2, 3 BHK Green-Side Residences at Chembur\nRunwal Enterprises\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\n3, 4 and 5 BHKs from ₹4.10 Cr at Sheth Avalon in Thane West\nSheth Avalon Thane\n|\nSponsored\nBook Now\nHiranandani Coming Soon to Alibaug With Assured Rentals\nHiranandani Exclusive\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThane Alert: Learn Winning Intraday Strategy from Mr. Bala\nTradeWise\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThane – Born before 1975?

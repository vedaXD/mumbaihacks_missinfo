The search results primarily discuss the demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in 2016 and a debunked claim about 500 rupee notes. The absence of credible sources confirming a ban on 10 rupee notes as of November 29, 2025, strongly suggests the claim is false. This aligns with a common misinformation pattern of spreading false information about currency bans.\\n\\n🐦 Social Media Perspective: Reddit (20 posts in r/leagueoflegends, wallstreet, BeAmazed): LIKELY_FALSE\n\n✓ High confidence based on multiple authoritative sources.",

      "explanation": "The search results are largely irrelevant to the claim that Modi said \"Soham is dumb.\" The results focus on unrelated topics such as economics, DID models (Difference in Differences), and multiple personality disorder. The absence of any credible sources reporting on this alleged statement, especially given the high profile of the person involved, suggests that the claim is likely false. Real events of this nature would generate widespread coverage. The claim also fits a pattern of political manipulation, where false quotes are attributed to politicians.\n\n💡 Analysis: The absence of credible sources for such a significant claim strongly suggests it is false. Real events of this magnitude generate immediate, widespread, and verifiable coverage from multiple news outlets.\\n\\n🐦 Social Media Perspective: Reddit (2 posts in r/youtubeindia, TMKOC): MIXED\n\n💾 This claim has been saved for periodic re-verification. You'll be notified when new information becomes available.",

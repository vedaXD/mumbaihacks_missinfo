      "explanation": "The search results are completely irrelevant to the claim that Modi said the earth is flat. The articles discuss Neil deGrasse Tyson, a rocket crash, and India's economic growth. The other web results discuss DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and econometric models. The absence of any credible sources for such a significant and easily verifiable claim strongly suggests it is false. A statement by a major political figure like Modi claiming the earth is flat would generate immediate and widespread coverage. The Reddit discussions also do not support the claim.\n\n💡 Analysis: The absence of credible sources for such a significant claim strongly suggests it is false. Real events of this magnitude generate immediate, widespread, and verifiable coverage from multiple news outlets.\\n\\n🐦 Social Media Perspective: Reddit (20 posts in r/HFY, BestofRedditorUpdates, CuratedTumblr): LIKELY_FALSE\n\n💾 This claim has been saved for periodic re-verification.

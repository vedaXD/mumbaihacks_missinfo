      "explanation": "The search results are relevant to the topic of Virat Kohli, but they do not confirm his retirement. The NDTV Sports articles discuss requests for a Sachin Tendulkar-like farewell and a gesture by Kohli in Adelaide, but neither explicitly states that he has retired. The Reddit discussions show mixed opinions, suggesting there is no clear consensus or confirmation. Given the significance of Virat Kohli and the lack of direct confirmation from credible sources, it is likely that he has not retired as of November 29, 2025. A major event like this would have widespread coverage.\n\n💡 Analysis: The absence of credible sources for such a significant claim strongly suggests it is false. Real events of this magnitude generate immediate, widespread, and verifiable coverage from multiple news outlets.\\n\\n🐦 Social Media Perspective: Reddit (12 posts in r/IndiaCricket, ViratKohli, bankingexam): MIXED",

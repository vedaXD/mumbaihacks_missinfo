      "explanation": "The search results indicate that there is speculation and \"retirement chatter\" surrounding Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, but no definitive confirmation of retirement. The NDTV Sports articles suggest the BCCI is responding to requests for Sachin Tendulkar-like farewells, implying no immediate retirement. The Reddit discussions also suggest the claim is likely false. A major event like Virat Kohli's retirement would have widespread and clear confirmation from multiple credible sources, which is currently lacking. The \"retirement chatter\" could be sensationalized speculation.\n\n💡 Analysis: The absence of credible sources for such a significant claim strongly suggests it is false. Real events of this magnitude generate immediate, widespread, and verifiable coverage from multiple news outlets.\\n\\n🐦 Social Media Perspective: Reddit (20 posts in r/IndiaCricket, Cricket, IndianCricket): LIKELY_FALSE",

They indicate that there have been discussions and speculation about the future of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, but they have not retired as of November 29, 2025. The Reddit discussions also reflect this uncertainty and speculation. The absence of any credible news sources confirming his retirement strongly suggests the claim is false.
